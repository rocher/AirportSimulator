# Airport Simulator

This is a game I wrote for processing just for fun, to play with `Physics`
and other classes and facilities.


## The Game
The game is quite easy: your mission is to take off all the airplanes
appearing in the airport. Drive them to the head of the runway, otherwise the
airplane cannot accelerate. Press space to full throttle (can't be
stopped). Make sure the airplanes are in the right direction (angle), they
have the appropriate velocity and are inside the bounds of the runway at the
time they leave the screen. The bigger the airplane, the greater the impulse.
